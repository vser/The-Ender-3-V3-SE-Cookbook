# The Ender 3 V3 SE Cookbook
Hopefully this grows to be a world of useful information as the printer is surprisingly cheap but most parts lack documentation, configuration and easily accessible guides.

***
##### General Note:
> As usual, most modifications can be easily troubleshooted- that being said, there is still a chance of bricking hardware if things go askew.  
> While tinkering can be fun, if you aren't able to risk the hardware you are modifying, it is highly recommended sticking with stock firmware images where possible.

***
##### Things to have documented overtime, in no specific order.
- General Hardware Information
- Replacement Component Information
- Modification Guides & Information
- Slicer Configuration/s & Filament Settings
- Guides for the SonicPad, BIGTREETECH Pad 7, etc.
- Literally anything Ender 3 V3 SE
- âœ¨Magic âœ¨

***
##### Where can I find this information...?
- General Files (Configs, Dumps, Firmware(s), etc) can be found on the [Main Repository](https://github.com/vser/The-Ender-3-V3-SE-Cookbook).
- Documentation (Specifications, Guides, etc) can be found on the [Repository Wiki](https://github.com/vser/The-Ender-3-V3-SE-Cookbook/wiki).
- Github wizards, please explain if there is an easier method to catalog this madness ðŸ™ƒ.
